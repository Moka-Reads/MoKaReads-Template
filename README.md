This is a template made to be used in any MoKa Reads publication and aimed to provide 
elegant styling that is not only beautiful for the users to read, but easy for the writer 
to create. This template does take inspiration from the `lachaise` template, but we have heavily modified 
our template for enhanced user's visuals towards the code snippets, and for books that contain examples for multiple 
languages, we provide environments for multiple languages (with more planned) that contain their icons and colours. 

To include this template into your project, you will simply need to place the 
`MoKa.tex` file into your project, and add the following line: 

```tex
\input{/path/to/MoKa.tex}
```
